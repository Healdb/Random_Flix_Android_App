Hey paul! 
So the main files exist in app/src/main
Android apps run with Activities, with child activities branching off of the main one.
These activities interact with the XML files in the res/layout files to determine the UI elements
The toolbar XML files are in res/menus, and the images are in both res/mipmap and res/drawable
